I am an energy engineer and project manager with over six years of experience in applied research within national and European-funded smart grid and energy transition projects. 

My research focuses on the analysis and simulation for smart grids and sustainable energy systems, and the development of optimisation and control algorithms for distributed energy resources (batteries, electric vehicles, heat pumps). 

I have led and participated in various research national and European research projects, contributing to the development of innovative smart grid solutions such as dynamic grid tariffs and demand-side management algorithms. 

One of my latest project - ["DynamiciTI"](https://m4.ti.ch/fileadmin/GENERALE/FER/documenti/Progetto_FER-DynamiciTI.pdf), the development and implementation of a dynamic grid tariff - was the 2025 Swiss Watt d'Or prize for energy innovation in the category “Special Jury Prize”.
