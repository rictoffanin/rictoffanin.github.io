I am an energy engineer and project manager with over six years of experience in applied research within national and European-funded smart grid and energy transition projects. 

My research focuses on the analysis and simulation for smart grids and sustainable energy systems, and the development of optimisation and control algorithms for distributed energy resources (batteries, electric vehicles, heat pumps). 

I am also familiar with data science techniques especially for analyzing high-resolution smart meter data. My work typically aims to extract insights from energy data in various applications: from improving the performance of an heat pump-based heating systems to scenario modeling for the future operation of hydropower plant with a stricter environmental regulation.


One of my latest project - ["DynamiciTI"](https://m4.ti.ch/fileadmin/GENERALE/FER/documenti/Progetto_FER-DynamiciTI.pdf), the development and implementation of a dynamic grid tariff - was the 2025 Swiss Watt d'Or prize for energy innovation in the category “Special Jury Prize”.
